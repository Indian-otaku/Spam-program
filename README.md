# Spam-program
## Introduction
### This project is used for spamming messages using [Pyautogui module](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of python. Additional modules used are [Time module](https://realpython.com/python-time-module/) and [Webbrowser module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html). 

## Warning
### The spamming lasted for around 25 minutes just by setting rounds as 2 for Lorem Ipsum. So use the variables generously.
